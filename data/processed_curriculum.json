    "original_solution": "1. Since $f(x) = \\log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \\log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \\neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \\log_a(1+x) - \\log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \\neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n1+x > 0 \\\\\n1-x > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSolving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.\n\n2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \\log_a(1-x) - \\log_a(1+x) = -[\\log_a(1+x) - \\log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.\n\n3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\\log_a(1+x) > \\log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-1 < x < 1 \\\\\n1+x > 1-x\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-1 < x < 1 \\\\\nx > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSolving this, we get $0 < x < 1$.

In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n1.

Since $\\ln x$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, if $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$, then $\\ln x_{1} < \\ln x_{2}$.\n3.

    "original_solution": "Given the constraints \\(1 \\leq x, y, z \\leq 6\\), we are to find the number of natural number combinations \\((x, y, z)\\) such that their product can be divided exactly by 10. \n\nTo begin, we observe:\n1. The total number of combinations of \\(x, y, z\\) is \\(6^3\\):\n   \\[\n   6^3 = 216\n   \\]\n\n2. To be divisible by 10, the product \\(xyz\\) must include both a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. Therefore, we need to evaluate the ways we can count combinations of \\(x, y, z\\) that miss these factors.\n\n3. Consider the cases where \\(x, y, z\\) do not include factors of 2. The numbers within the range that are not multiples of 2 are \\{1, 3, 5\\}. The number of combinations in this case is:\n   \\[\n   3^3 = 27\n   \\]\n\n4. Next, consider the cases where \\(x, y, z\\) do not include factors of 5. The numbers within the range that are not multiples of 5 are \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}. The number of combinations in this case is:\n   \\[\n   5^3 = 125\n   \\]\n\n5. Now consider the cases where \\(x, y, z\\) include neither factors of 2 nor factors of 5. The only valid numbers in the range are then \\{1, 3\\}. The number of combinations in this case is:\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n\n6. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the number of combinations where \\(xyz\\) is not divisible by 10:\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) is the set of combinations not including any multiples of 2 (27 in total) and \\(B\\) is the set not including any multiples of 5 (125 in total), and \\(|A \\cap B| = 8\\):\n\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B| = 27 + 125 - 8 = 144\n   \\]\n\n7. Therefore, the number of combinations where \\(xyz\\) is divisible by 10 is:\n   \\[\n   6^3 - |A \\cup B| = 216 - 144 = 72\n   \\]\n\nConclusively, the number of natural number combinations \\(x, y, z\\) such that their product is divisible by 10 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",

Casey will be staying 3 months, each with exactly 4 weeks. She saves $360 by paying monthly. What is the weekly charge for the motel?",
    "original_solution": "Let's denote the weekly charge for the motel as W dollars.\n\nCasey is staying for 3 months, and each month has exactly 4 weeks. So, she would be staying for a total of 3 months * 4 weeks/month = 12 weeks.\n\nIf she were to pay weekly, her total cost would be 12 weeks * W dollars/week.\n\nHowever, she is given the option to pay monthly at a rate of $1000/month. Since she is staying for 3 months, her total cost for paying monthly would be 3 months * $1000/month = $3000.\n\nWe are told that by paying monthly, Casey saves $360. This means that the total cost of paying weekly is $360 more than the total cost of paying monthly.\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12W (total cost if paying weekly) = $3000 (total cost if paying monthly) + $360 (savings by paying monthly)\n\nNow we can solve for W:\n\n12W = $3000 + $360\n12W = $3360\n\nDivide both sides by 12 to find the weekly charge:\n\nW = $3360 / 12\nW = $280\n\nTherefore, the weekly charge for the motel is $\\boxed{\\$280}$ .",

    "original_solution": "\nGiven the problem:\n> Prove that for each \\( n \\geq 2 \\), there is a set \\( S \\) of \\( n \\) integers such that \\( (a-b)^2 \\) divides \\( ab \\) for every distinct \\( a, b \\in S \\).\n\nWe aim to show that such a set \\( S \\) exists for all \\( n \\geq 2 \\). To do this, we rely on the direct corollary of a more general result proved in the USA TST 2015 problem. The more general problem states:\n\n> Prove that for every positive integer \\( n \\), there exists a set \\( S \\) of \\( n \\) positive integers such that for any two distinct \\( a, b \\in S \\), \\( a - b \\) divides \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) but not any other element of \\( S \\).\n\nTo utilize this theorem, let's recall the problem statement from the USA TST 2015:\n\n1. For any \\( n \\geq 2 \\), there exists a set \\( S \\) of \\( n \\) positive integers.\n2. Each pair of distinct elements \\( a, b \\) in this set satisfies the condition that \\( a - b \\) divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nBased on the USA TST 2015 problem, consider the specific construction: \n- Let \\( S = \\{ k, k(k + 1), k(k + 1)(k + 2), \\dots, k(k + 1)(k + 2) \\ldots (k + n - 1) \\} \\)\n- Here, \\( k \\) is a positive integer.\n\nWe need to verify that for any distinct \\( a, b \\in S \\):\n- \\( (a - b)^2 \\) divides \\( ab \\).\n\nBy the construction, each element of the set \\( S \\) looks like a product of consecutive integers starting from \\( k \\). Thus, for any two distinct elements \\( a, b \\) in the set \\( S \\):\n\n- Let \\( a = k(k + 1)\\ldots(k + i) \\) and \\( b = k (k + 1)\\ldots (k + j) \\) where \\( i \\neq j \\).\n- Without loss of generality, suppose \\( i < j \\). So \\( b = a(k+i+1)(k+i+2)\\ldots(k+j) \\).\n\nThe difference \\( a - b \\) would involve subtracting two such products where one is a subset of the factors of the other.\n\nNow consider \\( (a - b)^2 \\):\n- Since \\( b \\) can be expressed in terms of \\( a \\), \\( b = a \\times (\\text{product of additional consecutive integers}) \\).\n- Therefore, \\( a - b \\) is \\( a \\) times (additional factors minus 1), ensuring \\( a - b \\) is symmetric in the factor \\( a \\).\n  \nThis symmetry ensures:\n- If \\( a - b \\) is significantly factored compared to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), then \\( (a - b)^2 \\) can fit as a divisor of the product \\( ab \\).\n\nThus, \\( (a-b)^2 \\) will divide \\( ab \\) by this careful selection and inherent symmetry their product restructuring provides.\n\nIn conclusion, by using the construction provided by USA TST 2015's criteria in the particular form of choosing elements that follow the first product of consecutive integers, we ensure that the set \\( S \\) satisfies the given condition for \\( n \\geq 2 \\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{ }\\)",

Using Euler's totient function, \\(\\phi(120) = 120 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2})(1 - \\frac{1}{3})(1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 120 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 32\\).\n\n2. **Exclude Multiples of 3**: Count the multiples of 3 that are coprime with 120:\n   - Among factors, 3 and multiples of 3 with only 3 as the odd prime factor are coprime with 120. This includes 3, 9, 15 (since 15 has 5, which is in 120's prime factorization, we exclude it), and 21.\n   - Only 3, 9, and 21 are valid, but need to be excluded due to the problem's condition.\n\n3. **Adjust Totient's Result**: Subtracting the count of valid multiples of 3 from \\(\\phi(120)\\), we have \\(32 - 3 = 29\\). Factoring in symmetry (accounting for \\(m\\) and \\(120 - m\\) giving the same star), the number of non-similar 120-pointed stars is \\(\\frac{29}{2}\\). Since \\(29\\) is odd, half of it will ignore the extra 1, leading to 14 full pairings and 1 unique configuration.\n\nThus, the number of non-similar regular 120-pointed stars under the new rule is \\( \\boxed{15} \\).",
