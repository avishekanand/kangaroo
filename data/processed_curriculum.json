To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n1+x > 0 \\\\\n1-x > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSolving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.\n\n2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \\log_a(1-x) - \\log_a(1+x) = -[\\log_a(1+x) - \\log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.\n\n3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\\log_a(1+x) > \\log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-1 < x < 1 \\\\\n1+x > 1-x\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n-1 < x < 1 \\\\\nx > 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSolving this, we get $0 < x < 1$.

What percentage of the cost does his partner cover?",
    "original_solution": "First, let's calculate the total square footage Tom needs for his 500 seat theater:\n\n12 square feet/seat * 500 seats = 6000 square feet\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the land based on the square footage:\n\n$5/square foot * 6000 square feet = $30,000\n\nSince construction costs twice as much as the land, we calculate the construction cost:\n\n2 * $30,000 = $60,000\n\nNow we have the total cost of the project by adding the land and construction costs:\n\n$30,000 (land) + $60,000 (construction) = $90,000\n\nTom spends $54,000, so we need to find out how much his partner covers. The partner's contribution plus Tom's contribution should equal the total cost:\n\nPartner's contribution + $54,000 = $90,000\n\nNow we solve for the partner's contribution:\n\nPartner's contribution = $90,000 - $54,000\nPartner's contribution = $36,000\n\nTo find the percentage the partner covers, we divide the partner's contribution by the total cost and multiply by 100:\n\n($36,000 / $90,000) * 100 = 0.4 * 100 = 40%\n\nTom's partner covers $\\boxed{40\\%}$  of the cost.",

Analyze $g'(x)$:\n   - When $0 < x < \\frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\\ln x + 2 < 0$, so $g(x)$ is decreasing.\n   - When $x > \\frac{1}{e^2}$, we have $\\ln x + 2 > 0$, so $g(x)$ is increasing.\n4. Conclusion for option A:\n   - If $0 < x_{1} < x_{2} < \\frac{1}{e^2}$, then $g(x_{1}) > g(x_{2})$, which means $x_{1}+f(x_{1}) > x_{2}+f(x_{2})$.

Since $\\ln x$ is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, if $0 < x_{1} < x_{2}$, then $\\ln x_{1} < \\ln x_{2}$.\n3.

For ${x_2} > {x_1} > \\frac{1}{e}$, $f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2})$.\n4.

The total number of combinations of \\(x, y, z\\) is \\(6^3\\):\n   \\[\n   6^3 = 216\n   \\]\n\n2. To be divisible by 10, the product \\(xyz\\) must include both a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. Therefore, we need to evaluate the ways we can count combinations of \\(x, y, z\\) that miss these factors.\n\n3. Consider the cases where \\(x, y, z\\) do not include factors of 2. The numbers within the range that are not multiples of 2 are \\{1, 3, 5\\}. The number of combinations in this case is:\n   \\[\n   3^3 = 27\n   \\]\n\n4. Next, consider the cases where \\(x, y, z\\) do not include factors of 5. The numbers within the range that are not multiples of 5 are \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\\}. The number of combinations in this case is:\n   \\[\n   5^3 = 125\n   \\]\n\n5. Now consider the cases where \\(x, y, z\\) include neither factors of 2 nor factors of 5. The only valid numbers in the range are then \\{1, 3\\}. The number of combinations in this case is:\n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n\n6. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the number of combinations where \\(xyz\\) is not divisible by 10:\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B|\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) is the set of combinations not including any multiples of 2 (27 in total) and \\(B\\) is the set not including any multiples of 5 (125 in total), and \\(|A \\cap B| = 8\\):\n\n   \\[\n   |A \\cup B| = 27 + 125 - 8 = 144\n   \\]\n\n7. Therefore, the number of combinations where \\(xyz\\) is divisible by 10 is:\n   \\[\n   6^3 - |A \\cup B| = 216 - 144 = 72\n   \\]\n\nConclusively, the number of natural number combinations \\(x, y, z\\) such that their product is divisible by 10 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{72}\n\\]",
