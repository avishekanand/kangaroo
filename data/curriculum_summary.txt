     Insight: Recognizing and applying the properties of cube roots, specifically that cubing both sides of an equation is a valid operation when isolating a cube root, and understanding that the cube root function is its own inverse (i.e., $\sqrt[3]{a} = b$ implies $(\sqrt[3]{a})^3 = b^3$).
  2. If $a^3 = b$, what can you deduce about the relationship between $a$ and $b$? Specifically, if $a = -2$, what would $b$ be?
     Answer: b = -8
     Insight: Recognizing and applying the properties of cube roots, specifically that cubing both sides of an equation is a valid operation when isolating a cube root, and understanding that the cube root function is its own inverse (i.e., $\sqrt[3]{a} = b$ implies $(\sqrt[3]{a})^3 = b^3$).
  3. Consider the equation $x^3 = 64$. What are the solutions for $x$?  Describe the relationship between the solutions and the number 64.
     Answer: x = 4, x = 4i, x = -4i.  The solutions are the cube roots of 64.
     Insight: Recognizing and applying the properties of cube roots, specifically that cubing both sides of an equation is a valid operation when isolating a cube root, and understanding that the cube root function is its own inverse (i.e., $\sqrt[3]{a} = b$ implies $(\sqrt[3]{a})^3 = b^3$).
  4. Given that $\sqrt[3]{a} = b$, prove algebraically that $a = b^3$.  Show your steps.
     Answer: Cube both sides of the equation: $(\sqrt[3]{a})^3 = b^3  => a = b^3$
     Insight: Recognizing and applying the properties of cube roots, specifically that cubing both sides of an equation is a valid operation when isolating a cube root, and understanding that the cube root function is its own inverse (i.e., $\sqrt[3]{a} = b$ implies $(\sqrt[3]{a})^3 = b^3$).
  5. Solve for $x$: $\sqrt[3]{x} = 2$.  Explain your steps, emphasizing the core principle of isolating the cube root.
     Answer: Cube both sides: $x = 2^3 = 8$
     Insight: Recognizing and applying the properties of cube roots, specifically that cubing both sides of an equation is a valid operation when isolating a cube root, and understanding that the cube root function is its own inverse (i.e., $\sqrt[3]{a} = b$ implies $(\sqrt[3]{a})^3 = b^3$).
