  6. Given a function $f(x) = 2x + 1$, find $f^{-1}(7)$.
     Answer: Let $y = 2x + 1$.  To find the inverse, solve for $x$: $x = rac{y-1}{2}$. So $f^{-1}(y) = rac{y-1}{2}$. Then $f^{-1}(7) = rac{7-1}{2} = rac{6}{2} = 3.
  7. What is the definition of an inverse function?
     Answer: An inverse function, $g^{-1}(x)$, reverses the operation of a function $g(x)$. If $g(x) = y$, then $g^{-1}(y) = x$.
